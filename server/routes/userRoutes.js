 * - retrieving a user's game stats (wins, total matches played, win rate)
 * - updating a user's match record after a game ends (win/loss)
 * - updating a user's profile information (display name, avatar, language preference, difficulty level)
 * all routes in this file interact with the User model
 * authentication is handled in authRoutes.js
